CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory C:/A_PCL/RenderEngine/Horde3D/project_glfw-prefix/src/project_glfw-build/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory c:/A_PCL/Horde3D-master/project_glfw-prefix/src/project_glfw-build where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
CMake Error: The source "C:/A_PCL/RenderEngine/Horde3D/project_glfw-prefix/src/project_glfw/CMakeLists.txt" does not match the source "C:/A_PCL/Horde3D-master/project_glfw-prefix/src/project_glfw/CMakeLists.txt" used to generate cache.  Re-run cmake with a different source directory.
