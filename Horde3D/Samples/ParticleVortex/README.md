# Particle Vortex

This sample shows particle simulation process using compute shaders.
Currently up to 1 million particles are simulated. 

## Input

 * Use WASD to move and the mouse to look around.
 * Hold down LSHIFT to move faster.
 * Space freezes the scene, hitting space two times freezes the camera as well.
 * F1 sets fullscreen mode.
 * F3 switches between hdr, standard forward lighting and deferred shading (currently works only with forward shading).
 * F6 toggles frame stats and information display.
 * F7 toggles debug view.
 * F8 toggles wireframe mode.
 * ESC quits the application.
